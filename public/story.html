        Here is a possible essay based on your prompt: As the man stood on the
        hill, he gazed out upon a world in utter chaos. Flames engulfed the
        landscape, consuming everything in their path. The once blue skies were
        now a deep, foreboding grey, filled with the smoke and ashes of
        destruction. The sounds of screams and wailing filled the air, as people
        ran frantically, seeking escape from the inferno. But it was too late.
        The damage was done. The world was ending, and it was all because of the
        wrong decisions that had been made. The rejection of Jesus, the one who
        had come to save humanity from itself, had sealed their fate. The man
        thought back to the times when Jesus had walked among them, teaching of
        love and compassion, of forgiveness and redemption. But they had
        rejected him, choosing instead to follow their own selfish desires and
        pride. Now, as the world burned around them, they realized too late the
        error of their ways. They had been warned, but they had refused to
        listen. And now, it was too late. But the man on the hill was not like
        the others. He had always believed in Jesus, and he had prepared for
        this moment. He turned and ran towards a spaceship that was waiting for
        him, its engines roaring as it prepared for takeoff. As he boarded the
        ship, the man felt a sense of relief wash over him. He had escaped the
        destruction of the world, and he would live on to tell the tale of what
        had happened. As the ship soared into the sky, the man looked back at
        the world he had left behind. He saw the flames engulfing the earth, and
        the people running in panic. He knew that he would never forget the
        sight, and he knew that he would always remember the lessons he had
        learned. The man's name was John, and he was a survivor. He had survived
        the end of the world, and he would live on to start anew. He knew that
        he would never forget the world that had been lost, but he also knew
        that he had been given a second chance. As the ship flew through the
        galaxy, John couldn't help but wonder what other wonders and dangers lay
        ahead. He knew that he would face many challenges, but he was ready. He
        had Jesus by his side, and he had the knowledge of what had happened to
        the world.
