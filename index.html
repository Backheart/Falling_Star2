                As the man stood on the hill, he gazed out upon a world in utter
                chaos. Flames engulfed the landscape, consuming everything in their
                path. The once blue skies were now a deep, foreboding grey, filled
                with the smoke and ashes of destruction. The sounds of screams and
                wailing filled the air, as people ran frantically, seeking escape
                from the inferno. But it was too late. The damage was done. The
                world was ending, and it was all because of the wrong decisions that
                had been made. The rejection of Jesus, the one who had come to save
                humanity from itself, had sealed their fate. <br /><br />The man thought back to
                the times when Jesus had walked among them, teaching of love and
                compassion, of forgiveness and redemption. But they had rejected
                him, choosing instead to follow their own selfish desires and pride.
                Now, as the world burned around them, they realized too late the
                error of their ways. They had been warned, but they had refused to
                listen. And now, it was too late. But the man on the hill was not
                like the others. He had always believed in Jesus, and he had
                prepared for this moment. He turned and ran towards a spaceship that
                was waiting for him, its engines roaring as it prepared for takeoff.
                As he boarded the ship, the man felt a sense of relief wash over
                him. He had escaped the destruction of the world, and he would live
                on to tell the tale of what had happened.
